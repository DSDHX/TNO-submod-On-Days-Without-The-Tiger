 BUR_U_E_Maung: "U E Maung"
 BUR_U_E_Maung_desc: "Born in 1898, U E Maung earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Yangon and became a lawyer in 1922. Over the years, he diligently worked in the legal field, publishing his acclaimed book 'Burmese Buddhist Law' which earned him high regard.\n\nAfter the war, U E Maung stepped out of the ivory tower of the legal world and entered politics, becoming a Chief Justice and a member of the Hluttaw. He served as the Foreign Minister in the cabinet of former Chief Justice U Tun Maung and, following U Tun Maung's sudden death, became the Minister of Justice in the cabinet of Thakin Kodaw Hmaing. Due to Kodaw Hmaing's compromising and caretaker nature, U E Maung became the de facto leader of the cabinet.\n\nAfter Supreme Leader Ba Maw was overthrown in the August Revolution, various factions weighed their options and ultimately nominated U E Maung, who had no conflicts with any faction and had extensive political experience, as the new Supreme Leader.\n\nU E Maung was acutely aware that, following Ba Maw's downfall, the position of Supreme Leader had become complex not only in its relationship with the Japanese but also with various government factions and the public. His most crucial task was to walk a tightrope while completing the constitutional amendments and signing national agreements. In these uncertain times, he aimed to carve out a new path for Burma." #专有名词更改：《缅甸佛教法》、吴登貌、德钦哥都迈、八月革命
 BUR_Thakin_Tin: "Thakin Tin"
 BUR_Thakin_Tin_hog_desc: "§YPrime Minister§!\n--------------\n§LThakin Tin was born in 1903 in a modest family in Pyawbwe, Burma. In 1927, he became a lawyer, joining the ranks of Burma's elite. He was part of the legal team during the Saya San trials. In 1940, Thakin Tin became the chairman of the All Burma Peasants' Union, marking the beginning of his political career as a peasant leader. He was also an officer in the Burma Independence Army and served as a secretary to Ba Maw.\n\nAfter the war, with the support of Ba Maw and other Thakin Party members and peasants, Thakin Tin became the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in the cabinet of U Tun Maung. During this period, he met U E Maung, who would later become the Supreme Leader. Despite several cabinet reshuffles, Thakin Tin remained in the cabinet due to his experience and connections. After the resignation of the U Aung Than cabinet, Thakin Tin was nominated and appointed by U E Maung as the new Prime Minister of Burma.\n\nThe 1960s were destined to be an extraordinary decade. Thakin Tin sensed increasing divisions within the government, escalating social conflicts, and intensifying ethnic issues. Even the traditionally neutral Burmese military began to stir. Thakin Tin was uncertain whether he could steer this ship effectively, but he knew that if it hit the reefs, there would be no escape for him.§!" #专有名词更改：沙耶山、缅甸独立军、吴昂丹

 BUR_idea_weak_economy: "Politics? It's the Economy, Fools!"
 BUR_idea_weak_economy_desc: "Burma, a nation traditionally rooted in agriculture and rich in natural resources, naturally relies on these sectors as its main economic pillars. However, ever since the Empire of Japan's sweeping victory in the Great East Asia War, Burma's former stature has been steadily declining. In both agriculture and resource industries, Burma finds itself unable to compete with major Co-Prosperity Sphere nations like China and Indonesia.\n\nEconomic issues perpetually threaten Burma's political landscape. The Burmese Communist Party, enjoying significant prestige in rural areas, has formed the Red Cultivators' Union with the aim of uniting rural forces and strengthening its own position. Even within the government, there's competition between the industrial faction led by Finance Minister U Kyaw Nyein and the agricultural faction represented by Prime Minister Thakin Tin. At one point, the tension escalated to the brink of dismissing the finance minister, a crisis ultimately defused by the personal intervention of the Supreme Leader.\n\nIn any case, limited funds cannot simultaneously address all sectors. Where Burma's fragile economic path will lead remains to be seen." #专有名词更改：红色耕种者联合会
 BUR_idea_Ambiguous_Constitution: "Ambiguous Constitution"
 BUR_idea_Ambiguous_Constitution_desc: "Burma's current constitution is a product conceived during the Great East Asia War by the then - Supreme Leader Ba Maw under the radiant rising sun. Naturally, this constitution outlines various aspects of the nation, but it glaringly lacks clarity in many critical areas. Whether it's the relationship between the Supreme Leader and the Prime Minister, or Burma's international standing - how does she navigate relations with her suzerain Japan and her closest neighbor India? This ambiguous constitution fails to provide clear guidance. Consequently, amending the constitution has become a shared consensus among reformist politicians.\n\nHowever, due to the inherent conservatism of the Hluttaw, coupled with the high threshold required for constitutional amendments - a three-quarters quorum and a two-thirds majority vote - this goal remains a distant prospect. What lies ahead on this path? I'm afraid even the Buddha would find it hard to answer."
 BUR_idea_Myanmar_style_oligarchy: "Burmese-style Administrative Oligarchy"
 BUR_idea_Myanmar_style_oligarchy_desc: "Facing overwhelming military and political challenges, Burma's elites have, to some extent, set aside ideological differences to establish a highly centralized administrative system in Yangon. Apart from the former Chief Justice and current Adipati (Supreme Leader) U E Maung, who regards the judiciary as his personal domain, other elites focus on developing their own power bases within the United Sinyatha Party.\n\nUnder the influence of veteran labor movement leader U Ba Hlay, who has since retired from politics, U Ba Swe and U Rashid have taken control of the trade unions. Thakin Lun commands the United Sinyatha Party's satellite party - the Workers and Peasants Party. Leaders of the All Burma Peasants' Union, Thakin Tin and Kyaw Dun, represent the nation's farmers. U Kyaw Nyein leads Burma's youth and heads another satellite party - the Socialist Party. Scholar U Nu dominates the educational sphere, enjoying the support of the Buddhist Sangha.\n\nUnder the largely apolitical Defense Minister Bo Let Ya, figures like Ne Win and Aung Gyi control the leadership of the Burmese military, waiting for the opportune moment to act. Finally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the pro-Japanese faction, led by Thakin Tun Oak and Thakin Ba Sein, keep a close watch on developments in Tokyo..." #专有名词更改：阿迪帕蒂、联合辛塔耶党、吴巴莱、吴巴瑞、吴拉希德、德钦伦、工农党、全缅甸农民同盟、觉敦、社会党、昂吉、德钦敦玉
